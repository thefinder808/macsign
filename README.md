# MacSign

Native macOS Authenticode signing for Windows artifacts — **no Windows machine, no `osslsigncode`, no `jsign`, no OpenSSL/JVM.** A fully managed .NET 10 engine.

> **Status: Phase 1 (the spine).** Signs **PE files** (`.exe`/`.dll`/`.sys`, including managed assemblies) with a **local PFX certificate**. Timestamping, Azure Trusted Signing, PKCS#11/HSM, PowerShell, and MSI come in later phases. See `OVERVIEW.md` and the design doc in the Obsidian vault (`Development/Projects/MacSign/Native Signing Engine.md`).

## Why

The cross-platform tools for signing Windows binaries from a Mac are fiddly CLIs. MacSign reimplements Authenticode natively in .NET so signing is a single dependency-clean, notarizable app — and so the format logic is unit-testable and fully under our control.

## Layout

| Project | What |
|---|---|
| `src/MacSign.Signing` | The engine. No third-party deps; one Microsoft platform package (`System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs`) for the CMS APIs. |
| `src/MacSign.Cli` | A thin console harness (`macsign`) — manual signing and the seed of the eventual GUI. |
| `src/MacSign.Fixture` | A trivial class library whose compiled DLL is the unsigned PE the tests/CI sign. |
| `tests/MacSign.Signing.Tests` | xUnit: PE digest, CMS framing, sign→verify round-trip, secret hygiene. |

## Build & test

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet test
```

## Sign something

```bash
# Make a throwaway self-signed code-signing cert (test/dev only):
PFX_PW=secret dotnet run --project src/MacSign.Cli -- \
  gen-test-cert --pfx test.pfx --cer test.cer --password-env PFX_PW

# Sign a PE in place:
PFX_PW=secret dotnet run --project src/MacSign.Cli -- \
  sign --pfx test.pfx --password-env PFX_PW --description "My App" some.dll
```

The password is read from an environment variable (or `--password`), never logged, and never placed on a child-process command line.

## Verifying the signature

The authoritative check is **Windows `signtool`**, run in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): the macOS job signs a fixture PE and uploads it; a `windows-latest` job runs `signtool verify /pa` against it. That gate proves the cross-platform claim and must stay green.

Locally on macOS you can sanity-check with `osslsigncode` (chain trust will fail for a self-signed cert — that's expected; supply the cert as a trusted root to get a full pass):

```bash
osslsigncode verify some.dll                       # parses + checks digest/signature
openssl x509 -inform DER -in test.cer -out test.pem
osslsigncode verify -CAfile test.pem -ignore-timestamp some.dll   # full pass
```
